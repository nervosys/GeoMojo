# GeoMojoðŸ”¥

GeoMojo is a geospatial toolkit for the [Mojo programming language](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo), a (soon-to-be) strict superset of the Python language. Rather than re-invent the wheel (pun intended), GeoMojo focuses on accelerating heavy computational operations or workloads. That is because Mojo can import and interoperate with arbitrary Python libraries such as GeoPandas, PyProj, Shapely, Xarray, Dask, _et cetera_.

## Status

Hello, world!

Join us in our effort to accelerate geospatial computation, including artificial intelligence (AI), remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS), and simulation modeling.

## Why Mojo?

Computer architectures are getting messy. Mojo is simple and fast. [_Really fast_](https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-a-journey-to-68-000x-speedup-over-python-part-3).

Mojo is not just another language in the Language Wars, but an entirely new approach to language design focusing on modern heterogeneous systems. That includes things like chiplets, accelerators, and unified memory, glued together with new interfaces such as Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe). Mojo is the culmination of its predecessors projects including LLVM, Swift, and MLIR. What makes Mojo special is its interpreter and compiler. That's right, Mojo can be interpreted dynamically or compiled into a static binary. It supports both dynamic and static data and functions. It's the ultimate have-your-cake-and-eat-it solution to the two-language problem. Mojo looks like vanilla Python and runs like hell on a wide variety of systems through zero-cost abstractions.
